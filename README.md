# Overview
**MusiKeys** is a hybrid Simon/platformer game where you have to climb platforms and hit the correct sequence of playing blocks.

Play with your keyboard like a piano! The **C note** is mapped to the **A key** on the keyboard, **D note** to **S key**, **E note** to **D key**, ... until the **B note** which is on the **J key**.

# Key mapping
To **move**, press the **left/right** arrow keys.

To **jump**, press the key corresponding to the musical note on the platform.

To **climb stairs**, press the key of the platform you want to reach. For example, to climb up to a **D platform**, press the **S or L** key. To climb down to a **C platform**, press the **A or K** key.
